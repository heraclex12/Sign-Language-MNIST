# Sign-Language-MNIST
Implement Logistic Regression image classification using scikit-learn and use Histogram of Oriented Gradient for feature extraction

This project is my class assignment, so I use Vietnamese to describe the code lines.

I built the unused Deep learning model and it archieved 89% accuracy score in test set. (high score in this data)
